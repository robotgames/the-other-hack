# The Whorl: How Did It Come to This?
## The City.  
Themuria was massive.  Roughly circular, roughly 1500 miles across, surrounded by a wall seven miles high, and home to many towers stretching more than ten miles high.
## The Anguish.  
Desperation separated Themuria from everywhere.  Inhabitants starved, then fed on whatever they could find; thousands of years of feral hordes in the ruins.  And the Whorl was haunted by spirits, ghosts, angels, demons, things that think they are gods and things that want to be, things trapped and unable to escape to other planes.  The Others.  Civilization tried again.
## The Deluge.  
Sabotage.  The city drowned, covered in a saltwater sea five miles deep.  Towers accumulated dirt and rock and became islands.  Three massive islands lie near the wall of the Whorl, the Outer Rim.  A few miles inside the Outer Rim is an archipelago, tens of thousands of islands, a circle a dozen miles wide and thousands of miles long: Lagos.  A jagged black axis, the Needle, a spike in the city center with sea and sky spinning about it, creating a constant wind and current of 15 miles per hour in the Outer Rim, faster inwards; power generation and easy sea travel.  Civilization tried once more.  
## The Blending Plague.  
A magical virus wove together creatures with one another or with inorganics.  The less chaotic such are called Weave, more chaotic are Tangles.  Giantkin are weaves of humans and trees, dwarves are weaves of humans and rock, and smolfolk are weaves of humans and rabbits.  Goblins are tangles of smolfolk and elements (fire, earth, air, water), … well, you get the idea.  And again, civilization scrabbled for purchase.
## The Crashing Waves.  
Scarce resources drove Outer Rim explorers into the Whorl and down the ancient towers of the city.  They searched for farmland and lumber, for gasses and metals, and for the lost technologies of the drowned city.  But exploration enraged the goblin hordes further into the Whorl.  They invaded the Outer Rim, three waves over hundreds of years.  Perhaps they have stopped, or perhaps a fourth wave forms.  But again, civilization.  
## The Stilling or the Gloaming?  
Many years.  The Outer Rim has settled into a fragile stability.  Human Weaves are the primary sentient creatures on land in the Outer Rim, and the whales in the sea.  Whales are intelligent but alien, sometimes incomprehensible to their “little land brethren”.

But the winds and waves slow, energy and trade dwindle; the Stilling.  And some folk have plumbed the depths of the ruins, but they wake sleeping things.  A dusky cloud - the Gloaming - now spreads in a district in Whitehall, the largest city in the Outer Rim, blanketing the area with darkness.  Rumors speak of roaming undead.

And despite the tangled horrors beneath their feet and the haunted cityscape they live atop, the inhabitants of the Outer Rim are full of hope and community.  What is left strives towards an industrial revolution of sorts.  Airships sail the sky, people speak of power generation and the economy, and there is hope for a future alongside planning for the next apocalypse.  This is not a desperate, dog-eat-dog world, though it should be.  It has enduring people who uplift one another.  This Other haunted land survives.
