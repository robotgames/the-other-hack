This is a continuation of my notes on the ttrpg setting Themuria, the Drowned City, the Whorl.  Part 1 appeared last week.  I'll be slowly filling in these notes, but don't expect answers.  Questions are much more interesting.  And don't expect coherence; the setting is being fleshed out nonlinearly, and there are hints of other elements everywhere.  *The system we have been using to explore the Whorl is a big bag of rules acquired from the Black Hack and its hacks, sort of a hacky-sack, called The Other Hack.*

Deities of the Whorl first.  Below that , you can find the next thirty relics in my list that's aiming for a hundred.

# Deities in the Whorl
The deities of the Whorl are the greater Others who have seized power.  There are four, or five, or more, dpeending on who counts.

The four well-acknowledged gods of the Whorl are the neutral gods Sil and Hel, and the opposed gods of good and evil, Themuria and Ta.  Tyche Set, the goddess of Luck, is well beloved by many and considered to be something like a younger sister tot he primary deities.

There are several more powerful Others in the Whorl, not worshipped widely as gods, but active to one degree or another in the affairs of the Whorl.  Creatures in the Whorl may seek out any of these poewrful Others for favors, or to serve them as their Chosen agents in the Whorl.

## Bentan Sil the Clockwork God
Bentan Sil is a patron of order.  Logic, light created to shine in dark places, mechanics like clockwork and gears and steam, civilization, mining, industry, and crafts and craftspeople.  Generally a benevolent and popular god in the Outer Rim, but generally a neutral one.

Favored weapon: Mace (one- or two-handed as a maul).

Creatures: Ants, spiders, woodpeckers, and blaze otters.

Bentan Sil rose to prominence during the Blending Plague.  As the horrors spread, warriors gathered in the name of Bentan Sil to protect the remaining pockets of civilization.  Legends say that Sil himself defended the last towns and stood with the armies of light on the walls, to defend against the chaotic monstrosities rising from the sea

## Themuria, the Drowning City
In the Whorl, the cradling earth is neither a stern father nor a nurturing mother.  It is a city whose deaths spawned the history of this world.  Themuria the ancient, the drowning city god in which the world resides.  Life, rebirth, revelation of hidden truths, knowledge, earth and rock, herons and whales.  The peoples of this land tell tales of Themuria’s destruction at the hands of Un Set Ta, its resurrection as the Whorl, and how the Chosen of Themuria led the peoples of the Outer Rim to the ruined towers of the city for shelter from the goblin invasions.  Themuria is seen as the protector of the peoples of the Outer Rim, the defender who lays down its life to hold the gate against the enemy hordes.

Favored weapon: Two-handed sword.

Creatures: Herons, stonebears, and deephins.

## Mornuvin Hel, the Beetle Lord
God of rot, decay, regrowth, fungus, and beetles.  Not of death, but of natural processes following death.  Hel is not a beloved god but is considered to be a neutral, natural, and orderly one.

Favored weapon: Staff.

Creatures: Beetles, fungus, and undead.

Hel worship increases significantly after each apocalypse, as the inhabitants of Themuria pray for the remains to decay and feed new crops.  Themurians have learned to use all the resources at their disposal.

## Un Set Ta, the Serpent Queen
Goddess of chaos, secrets, death, depths, darkness and shadows, concealment, betrayal.  Ta is feared in the Outer Rim, but she is seen as necessary in some times and places.  Her worship - where it occurs - is conducted in secret, and in many towns serpent worship is expressly forbidden.

Favored weapon: Dagger.

Creatures: Serpents, snarecats, and piranhas

Ta worship pre-dates the Deluge.  The Serpent Queen is widely acknowledged to be responsible for the schemes which led to the Deluge and the drowning of the city.  Un Set Ta and Themuria stand in opposition to each other.

## Tyche Set, the Smiling Storm
Tyche Set is said to be the younger sister to the four major gods of the Whorl; her devout would say that they all bow to her from time to time.  She is the storm that destroys ships and washes up treasures from the depths.  She is the avalanche that crushes the village and reveals the hidden riches within the mountain.  She is luck, chance, fate, and fortune.  Tyche is worshiped by gamblers, sailors, sorcerers, and adventurers.  Her symbols are rabbits, frogs, and clover.

Favored weapon: Sling.

Creatures: Rabbits, deepfrogs, and fateshrikes.

## Torre Dun Sheggoth, the Hunter
A demon rumored to hunt the Whorl from its home in the Needle.  Some say it has the shape of a monstrous fish, others an enormous bird, and still others say it is a foul mist that devours.  Sheggoth does not participate in the affairs of mortals beyond identifying their greatest hunters and setting them to find the most dangerous prey in the Whorl: leviathans in the deeps, tangles living in the dark ruins, and the most dangerous warriors, killers, and assassins among humankind.

Favored weapon: Bow

Creatures: Grimbudgies and sharks

## Conogorrah the Eleven-Eyed Collector
Perhaps a famed wizard, perhaps an old god with a hobby.  Conogorrah appears to its followers in indistinct form, with eleven eyes - said to be on stalks by some - floating in a thick mist.  The Collector is one of the most mysterious patrons, but is also one of the most easy to understand.  It simply wants to expand its collection, and tasks its Chosen with doing so.  But what does it collect?  By all reports: books for its library, creatures for its zoo, and curiosities both magical and mundane.

Favored weapon: Axe (one- or two-handed)

Creatures: Squirrels, ravens, and hoardcrabs

## La Merrogath the Reconciler
Once a Chosen of Un Set Ta, La Merrogath is the only mortal - or so it is said - to have gained any glimpse of the infinite depths of future time.  But, she was cursed to see only one potential timeline.  In doing so she died and her ghost gained great power, but in gaining that power she became trapped by the future she saw.  She works to reconcile the future she believes must pass with the future she sees unspooling before her.  Merrogath’s powers from her time as a Chosen are legend among all faithful.  Her service to Ta is often connected with the Deluge in historical records.  Her powers as an Other are undoubtedly great as well; the Crashing Waves are said to have been inspired by a ghost priestess obsessed with time and its correcting, a priestess whose followers called her the Reconciler.  Whether or not these legends are true, Merrogath is certainly one of the most active patrons in the Whorl, mistress of schemes and manipulation.

Favored weapon: Spear

Creatures: Slipfoxes, flying tortoises, and octopi

## Buggash Dun Aggarath, the Dream Worms
Migrating colony of enormous dream worms that haunt Suenomara, the dream sea-of-sand.  Some say they are merely the power of living dreams condensed, others believe they have an alien consciousness.  If you want to know what Aggarath wants, or whether it is too alien to want anything in the sense we mean it, you will have to find that out yourself.  Aggarath’s Chosen never speak of their dealings with it.

Favored weapon: Unarmed.

Creatures: Cats, dragonflies, and knowleeches.

*A side note on Suenomara, the Dream Sea-of-Sand:*  While it is true that Themuria has been cut off from all other planes and worlds, it could not be separated from its own inhabitants.  As in all worlds, the collective psyches of all beings gather and chat, and as in all words, the place they construct to do that is always the dream sea.

But as with Themuria itself, the dream sea, Suenomara, has been transformed by apocalypse.  It is dry, emptied, a vast sand-choked desert of the unconscious dreaming mind.  Dream things prowl its wastes and dreamers still visit it from time to time.

The wise have many theories about what happened to Suenomara.  Advanced logarithmic eschatonics and other such theoretical wizardry aside, the simplest question remains: where did all the water in the sea of dreams go?  And that is so tantalizingly related to the central mystery of Themuria’s drowning: where did all the water in the Whorl come from?

But in any case, Suenomara is now a desert, a vast sea of sand and rock lying under a perpetually starlit sky.  Dreamers still wander there, and their dreams still shape it.  Dream things still haunt it, and if they are different now, horrifying and insane and carnivorously tricksy, well, one must adapt to one’s environment, adapt or die…and dream things cannot die.

If you can find the mind of a dreamer in Suenomara, you may discover things from it that their waking mind was too guarded to reveal.

Cats of all sizes have a special relationship with the dream sea.  It is said there is one last oasis in Suenomara, a last, vast pool of dream water.  It is said that the great dream city of Ultana is built on its shores.  It is said that Ultana is the true home of all cats and is ruled by them, it is said that they can always find their way home in times of great need, and it is said that Ultana’s streets and alleys lead to every dream sea in every world.  But none of this is said by cats.  They care not for bipedal ways, and they count themselves wise to avoid speaking of much at all.  Perhaps they have the right of it.
