# The Outer Rim
In this post we'll take a look at some locations in the Whorl outside the Braes, with a focus on the three largest islands in the Outer Rim.

Down below, forty more relics you might find in the Whorl.

## Outside the Braes
### The Wall
The Whorl was not formed by geological processes.  Its lands are twisted and disturb the sensibilities of outsiders.  Everything we see is the accumulated dirt of ages, deposited in crusty aggregation on the tops of the towers of a dead city.  When we speak of an island, we mean to say the top of an ancient building extending above the water.  

Not that the placement of the Whorl's islands is chaotic.  To the contrary, the Whorl has too much structure and an abundance of symmetry.  Purpose and design?  If one could delve the minds of the dead, perhaps one could discern such.  The current residents of the Whorl know only that much about their history is lost.  They do not even know what species built the city that cradles their sea.

The Whorl is a roughly circular sea.  Its waters are held in by **the Wall**, a literal wall surrounding the city.  Colonies of winged humanoids - Virios - live in the part of the wall above water; it is thought that sister colonies of sea people live below.  Whatever their original purpose, the Virio now consider themselves the guardians of the Wall, and suffer few to approach.  Virio hunters and fishers are ferocious, but their colonies are vast.  Outer Rim scholars believe they must be supported by some other food source.

### The Outer Rim
Inside the Wall, a short expanse of sea, and then the Outer Rim.  The Rim is a circular archipelago of thousands of islands, but three make up over ninety percent of the Rim's available land: Spear, Moon, and Quentish.  More on each of those later, but for now...

**Spear** is named for the massive tower of ruins emerging from one end, leaning slightly out to sea, and also known as the Spear.  The largest city in the Whorl, Whitehall, is built at the base of the Spear.  Its seat of government is housed in the ruins, in halls of the strange white stone of the ancients.  Spear's main industries are shipbuilding and mining, and the financial district in Whitehall is the only place in the Rim to speculate and invest.  Arguably, Spear is the seat of power in the Outer Rim.

**Moon** is named for its shape, a massive crescent moon sheltering the largest harbor in the Whorl.  The inner side of the crescent is a beach made of fine, white sand, valuable for glassmaking.  The wizards of the Whorl make their home on Moon, to be closer to the source of the glass they prize for their work.  *Note: Wizards are quite distinct from mages in this world.  Mages are casters of spells and workers of magics.  Wizards are...something else.  They manipulate and twist natural forces to their unnatural ends.  While this has resulted in gunpowder, excellent optical devices, and airships, it's broadly understood that wizards were at least in part responsible for the the Blending Plague.  Wizards are well-respected and avoided whenever possible.  Many will mark the sign of the Moon wizards, a rectangle with a crude slash running diagonally through it, at establishments known to be frequented by wizards.  More on mages and wizards another time.*  A cluster of hundreds of islands lies between the horns of Moon, called the Tears of the Moon.  When asked, residents of the Whorl will have no idea why Moon is named as it is.  *Their* moon is a simple sphere, unchanging in shape, size, or position, always hanging at the same location on the Needle, and very faintly visible during the day.

**Quence** is the largest island in the Rim.  Its primary industries are agriculture, fishing, and timber.  

### Lagos
A dozen or more miles of sea separate the Outer Rim from a second massive circular archipelago, Lagos.  Lagos has no islands nearing the size of Spear, Moon, or Quence, but its tens of thousands of islands collectively have more area.  

### The Towers
Another dozen or so miles of sea, and then the Towers, a circular archipelago made up of massively tall islands.  Most rise at least a hundred feet vertically out of the water.  The Towers is home to what may be the second largest city in the Whorl, Sanctuary.  Named for its role in sheltering refugees during the goblin invasions of the Crashing Waves, Sanctuary is a massive tower with a flat top sitting a few undred feet off the sea.  A makeshift system of docks and nets allows ships to tie up and become, briefly, part of the city.  Sanctuary is unregulated by the Outer Rim, though Whitehall has made attempts.  Sanctuary is now a refuge for many who prefer a different lifestyle and a more flexible moral structure.  

As one moves further into the Whorl, the winds and currents increase, and beyond the Towers is where that effect can begin to make ship handling more challenging.  With constant currents, ships in the Whorl don't have sails; there's never been a need.  No, ships in the Whorl don't face problems with moving, only with stopping, and so most ships are equipped with large, launch-able grappling hooks to latch on to whatever island they happen to be passing.  No sails, just brakes.  Further into the Whorl, the currents begin to reach speeds that may rip the brakes off the ships.

### The Braes
Beyond the Towers, another few doze miles of sea, and then the Braes.  This is a massive ring of stone rising out of the sea and circling the Whorl.  It is named the Braes in joking reference to its vague similarity to a sequence of vertebrae.  No mapped passage through the Braes is known, though there are always rumors.  There are also rumored to be cities atop the Braes, and of course the Whorl continues inside.  But, the Braes can be thought of as the limit of what the Outer Rim knows.
